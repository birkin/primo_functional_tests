- âˆš add elapsed-time for individual bib, vs elapsed time for set.

- replace the sleep with a simple selenium driver instantiation and access. this'll let us know if this concurrency is possible with selenium. I think it will be, given selenium's use of trio.

- research and try out writing out the result of each test to a json file. although if i were really updating a google-sheet, that could postentially, if not likely, be done concurrently.
