next...

âˆš replace working Lock() with Semaphore( 0 ) and test.

- while I have the existing error, improve error-handling so the process is closed. (continue)

- handle dict correctly.

timing semaphore vs lock
- 1000 jobs w/100 workers, 
- each job randomly takes between .4 and .6 seconds
- initial uncounted run (setting cache?)
- running 5 times, 
- dropping the high and low
- averaging 3
- rounding down to hundredth
